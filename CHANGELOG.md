# Changelog

All notable changes to the TEDI Remote Access extension are documented here.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-19

- **SSH tab mirroring.** SSH tabs you open in TEDI now mirror to the browser
  (sky stripe + `ssh` badge). Because SSH sessions live in the GUI process (not
  the PTY daemon), a webview bridge attaches to each via the host `ssh_attach`
  command and forwards it to the relay as a SECOND source; input routes back
  through `ssh_write` / `ssh_resize`.
- **Relay multi-source.** The relay now accepts multiple agent sources (native
  PTY agent + SSH bridge), merges their session lists, and broadcasts browser
  input to all sources (each ignores ids it doesn't own — no PTY regression).
  Header-less WS sources authenticate with a short-lived ticket
  (`POST /api/agent-ticket`).
- Requires a TEDI build exposing `ssh_list_sessions` / `ssh_attach` +
  `ctx.invokeChannel` (a TEDI core change). On older builds the SSH bridge
  transparently no-ops and only local terminals mirror.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-18

- Initial release.
- **Mirror your open terminals to a browser anywhere.** The native agent attaches
  to TEDI's PTY daemon as a second subscriber (replayed scrollback + live
  output), forwards over an outbound WSS to a self-hosted relay, and a browser
  SPA renders the sessions with xterm.js. Typing drives the same PTY, so input
  shows on the desktop too.
- **Browser client** — React + Tailwind v4 + shadcn using TEDI's design tokens
  (1px borders, no radius, Hugeicons, matching tooltips), clear terminal tab
  navigation, a mobile helper-key bar (Esc / Tab / Ctrl / arrows / symbols),
  responsive layout, login (password + optional TOTP), font controls, and
  auto-reconnect with scrollback replay.
- **Relay** — a small Node `ws` broker that authenticates the host agent
  (bearer token) and browser clients (login cookie), pipes opaque frames, and is
  fronted by nginx for TLS. Rate-limited login with lockout, gzip, immutable
  asset caching, SPA fallback, graceful shutdown.
- **SSH-tab groundwork** — the browser already renders SSH tabs distinctly (sky
  stripe + `ssh` badge). Live SSH mirroring needs a TEDI build that exposes the
  `ssh_attach` host command (TEDI's SSH sessions live in the GUI process, not the
  PTY daemon); until then the extension mirrors local terminals only. Tracked for
  a follow-up release.
- Status-bar connection indicator; toggle with **Ctrl+Alt+R**.
